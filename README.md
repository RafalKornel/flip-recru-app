## Getting Started

# Performance note

During development you may see that performance (navigation between pages, more specificly) is really slow. This is caused by API performance.
In 'production' environment, this shouldn't be an issue, because pages will be generated staticaly,
wheras on development, API gets called on every request.

# Your Task - Star Wars Navigation System

There is no one who does not know the **Star Wars** universe. If, however, it has survived - it better be hidden. In Flip - we definitely stand on the **Light Side of the Force**.
To prove your strength and join the **Jedi Flip Council**, you must pass a test task that tests your experience, cunning and determination.
The final test is ahead of you. Make fresh coffee, put on your favorite slippers and get ready for the adventure of a lifetime.

Your task is to write an Application thanks to which **Stormtroopers** will be able to navigate between solar systems.
You can use our top secret **Jedi Flip Council Archives** for this task.
